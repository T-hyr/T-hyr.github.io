              Context: Within TotalEnergies' French subsidiary, in the OneTech branch in charge of the Group's research, I am involved in the research and automation of processes used by the various teams linked to the Group's renewable energies. These processes are based on the use of aggregated internal TotalEnergies data, and sometimes external public or private data, to meet the needs of the business teams.
              
              Objective: To research and test new approaches to help the business lines improve the reliability and performance of their operating processes. To be a source of ideas for the business, demonstrating the power of data to optimise and improve processes. Working on data exploration, analysis and features engineering, with presentations to the business teams. Development of machine learning and deep learning models.
              
              Project 1: Short-term (5 min) and mid-term (15 days) forecasting of electricity production from offshore wind turbines using Lidar and meteorological data (Stacking, Transformer, CNN, RNN/LSTM, XGBoost and LGBM). Improvement of 20% on average compared with existing approaches.
              
              Project 2: Long-term forecasting (3 days) for photovoltaic production. Use of local meteorological data and time series data. 
              
              Project 3: Optimisation of energy consumption in homes, with savings of up to 40% in terms of expenditure and cost. Taking into account the thermal comfort of residents and the price of energy.
